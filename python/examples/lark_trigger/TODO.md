- All IM messaging events (5 events)
- Calendar event changes (1 event)
- Approval workflow updates (1 event)

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Guidelines
- Each event handler extracts explicit fields from Lark SDK models (no __dict__)
- Keep integer and boolean types as-is (don't convert to strings)
- Convert complex objects/arrays to JSON strings for Dify Variables compatibility
- Provide human-friendly labels and descriptions in EN/ZH/JA
- Register dispatch handlers in provider/lark.py for each event
- Reference all events in provider/lark.yaml events section

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production
All implemented events have been:
- Properly typed with correct data types
- Registered with dispatch handlers
- Referenced in provider configuration
- Tested for type safety
