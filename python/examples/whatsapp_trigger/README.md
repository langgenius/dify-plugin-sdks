â”‚   â””â”€â”€ whatsapp.py      # Core webhook handling
â”œâ”€â”€ triggers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ message_*.yaml   # Trigger definitions

```

## Security Considerations

1. **Always use HTTPS** for webhook endpoints
2. **Validate signatures** on all incoming requests
3. **Store credentials securely** in Dify's credential manager
4. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
5. **Monitor webhook logs** for suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Check webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify token matches configuration
   - Ensure webhook is subscribed to correct fields

2. **Signature validation failing**
   - Verify App Secret is correct
   - Check system time synchronization
   - Ensure raw body is used for validation

3. **Missing message data**
   - Check API permissions
   - Verify phone number is registered
   - Ensure webhook version is compatible

## Contributing

To extend this plugin with new triggers:

1. Create trigger definition in `triggers/[name].yaml`
2. Implement trigger logic in `triggers/[name].py`
3. Add trigger to `provider/whatsapp.yaml`
4. Test with sample webhook payloads
